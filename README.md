## Final Thoughts

### I did have to chance the page where I wanted new inteasd it was better to let people pick which news outlet to pick on the soruces page.

### I problem I couldn't fix was the start up music since Google chrome doesn't approve of it unless people had the option to play it, which would ruin the intro
